        <p>Welcome to our homepage! Here are instructions and policies that you <span class="font-weight-bold">MUST</span> familiarize yourself before participating in the study.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">A. INSTRUCTIONS:</p>

        <p>1. Once you click on Log In (once you accept the consent form on the next page), the study will ask you to choose a username and a password. You will find the singup option on the login page. In case you lose any of this information, please start again.</p>

        <p>2. During the study, we will collect the information related to your keyboard and mouse behavior ONLY. We will not store your username, password or your choice in the application. Additionally, as a participant, throughout and after the study, your identity will be completely anonymous.</p>

        <p>3. To participate in the study, you must be <span class="font-weight-bold">18 years or older</span>.</p>

        <p>4. <span class="font-weight-bold">A successful study requires the participant to successfully log in at least 25 times using the same credentials.</span> As a participant, you may choose to participate more than 25 times however.</p>

        <p>5. <span class="font-weight-bold">Participants should not use features like autofill passwords, password managers, etc. to store the username and/or password for this website</span>. Doing so may disqualify such login attempts. We have done our best to disable automatic browser behaviors, but as a participant, it is ultimately your responsibility.</p>

        <p>6. The participation in this study is completely voluntary, and additionally, as a participant, you may choose to withdraw from the study by not participating in the experiment any more than 25 times, in which case your data is automatically deleted.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">B. REIMBURSEMENT:</p>

        <p>1. Your participation is voluntary, but it will help us develop a better authentication scheme. Other than hearty and sincere thanks and appreciation ❤️❤️❤️, we can't offer you much. There are no monetary reimbursements associated with this study.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">C. HELP/CONTACTS:</p>

        <p>At any point during the study, you may reach out to us at <span class="font-weight-bold">david.ahmad@nyu.edu</span> or <span class="font-weight-bold">christina.poepper@nyu.edu</span> for any information, support, or clarifications regarding this study.</p>
